# Harvest / PivotalTracker Browser Extension

The missing link between Harvest and PivotalTracker -- track your time
directly from the PivotalTracker interface.

We use Harvest. We use PivotalTracker. We thought it would be cool to link up
our Harvest timesheets directly to our PivotalTracker stories to simplify
tracking and review.
